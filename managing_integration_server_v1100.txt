Managing the webMethods Integration Server v11_00


Integration Server Directory:

/Applications/wMServiceDesigner/IntegrationServer

* Note starting using bash since we're in zsh shell

Starting the integration server:

Change directory to the following:

/Applications/wMServiceDesigner/IntegrationServer/bin

** sudo /bin/bash /Applications/wMServiceDesigner/IntegrationServer/bin/startup.sh

To stop the integration server, use the following:

** sudo /bin/bash /Applications/wMServiceDesigner/IntegrationServer/bin/shutdown.sh

or from the Administrator application, choose Server control icon > Shutdown or restart > choose the desired Shut Down or Restart option, then select the Shut Down button.

* Note that since bash and zsh are very close in functionality, using the zsh shell seems to work as expected. 

** Since zsh and bash are so close in functionality, it appears that the /bin/bash is not really required, nor is it required to change the default shell to /bin/bash. 

There are alternatives to the startup.sh script in the bin directory.  It is also possible to start the IS using the server.sh script, then 

ctrl-z, bg

but it had been so long since we'd run the IS that we'd forgotten about the startup.sh.
